Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

This project leverages Flask and Bootstrap to deploy a small web application aimed at logging academic advising appointments and their pertinent details. 
Users can register, login, and create and edit appointment records. When creating or editing an appointment, users can record information such as the date of the appointment, student name and ID, advisor, topic, and additional notes.
